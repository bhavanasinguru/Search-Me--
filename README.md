Search Me!
I have used tesseract ocr for image processing in the above program.The user needs to type  the name which he/she wants to search. The code works in the following way:
•	The directory of the folder is specified in the location
•	Object f of File type stores the location of each file in the folder
•	It is kept in a for each loop and text of each file is read and stored in a String variable
•	This is compared with the  user input and if it is found then the name of the file in which it is found is displayed.
•	In the above case both the strings are converted to lower case to make it user-friendly
•	If no file is found then a message “not found” is  displayed.
