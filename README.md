Search Me!


I have used tesseract ocr for image processing in the above program.
The user needs to type  the name which he/she wants to search. The code works in the following way:
The directory of the folder is specified in the location
Object f of File type stores the location of each file in the folder
It is kept in a for each loop and text of each file is read and stored in a String variable
This is compared with the  user input and if it is found then the name of the file in which it is found is displayed.
In the above case both the strings are converted to lower case to make it user-friendly
If no file is found then a message “not found” is  displayed.
